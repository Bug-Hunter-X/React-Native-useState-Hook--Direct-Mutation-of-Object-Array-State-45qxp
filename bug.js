This error occurs when using the `useState` hook in React Native with an object or array as the initial state.  If you modify the state object or array directly using methods like `push()`, `splice()`, or by assigning new properties, React won't detect the change and the UI won't update. This is because React performs a shallow comparison of the previous and new state values.  If the reference to the object or array remains the same, React thinks nothing has changed.

```javascript
// Incorrect:
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [myArray, setMyArray] = useState([1, 2, 3]);

  const addElement = () => {
    myArray.push(4); // This won't trigger a re-render
    setMyArray(myArray); //This is wrong too because it points to the same reference
  };

  return (
    <View>
      {myArray.map((item) => (
        <Text key={item}>{item}</Text>
      ))}
      <Button title="Add Element" onPress={addElement} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
